1: [Combat Events that start with 0 energy] Please stop making events or onslaught where characters start without their bursts full, not only do you have a time limit but have to waste a significant portion of it trying to get your bursts back, this is bad game design and nobody wants it.
2: [Artifact Loadouts] The current artifact loadout system is terrible and useless. What the players would like, is to be able to create artifact loadouts manually from hand-picking artifacts for a character, and save those loadouts in order to equip them in one go, instead of having to equip artifacts one by one if we want to change a character's build. The current system can be built upon in order to do this, but in its current state is completely pointless to most players, and not what we are asking for.
3: [Artifact Exp Domain] Add a domain to farm artifact exp instead of artifacts, like in ZZZ. we get so many artifacts but never enough exp and mora to level them.
4: [Chest Compass] Make the compass for each area also show all puzzles (chests that aren't already spawned on the map), and if necessary, show all chests, but only after reaching 95% or 100% on the in-game map.
5: [Mora Chests] Make the mora dropped from mora chests, rock piles etc. go directly to the inventory, because if you teleport immediately after opening one of them, the mora stays there and never gets to you, which is not known by most players.
6: [Game Size] Add the ability to delete old resources on PC, the game's size is getting out of hand.
7: [Mona C1 Bug] Mona's C1 is bugged, the 15% duration increase of frozen does not work.
8: [Change Language During dialogue] Give us the ability to change voice over language during dialogue.
9: [Zoom Out] Gives us the ability to zoom out further.
10: [Anecdotes Event] Make the anecdotes event a permanent feature.
11: [Time Wasting Enemies] Stop making enemies that bury underground or fly up for long amounts of time (Geo Wolflord, Wenut), making it impossible to attack them and makes you waste time in a time limited challenge. It's very bad game design, feels like damage is being wasted and it's very frustrating. It's more fun if enemies have higher HP but are more fair to fight.
12: [World Boss Drops] Please add a way to use old world boss materials that have become useless, to make something more useful, like other boss materials. Example: transform 3 random boss materials (pyro whopper flower*2 + cryo whopperflower) into 1 boss material we need, like 1 primo geovishap.
13: [Weekly Gadgets] Like the parametric transformer and the artifact transmuter, make them reset on monday morning reset just like Escoffier's cooking mechanism.
14: [Weekly Gadgets] There should be a visible indicator for gadgets that are useabe once in a while, like the parametric transformer and the artifact transmuter, without having to go to the inventory to see them, maybe something on the map screen?
15: [Local Specialty Cooking Ingredients] Add the ability to "Go to collect" for local specialty cooking ingredients like cacahuatl, bulle fruit, etc.
16: [Sigils] Please add the ability to spend 1 anemo/geo sigil instead of 2, just like with electro/dendro sigils, so that they don't stay in the inventory in we have 1 left.
17: [Ultra-Hot Burner Lamp Test Model] Please add the Ultra-Hot Burner Lamp Test Model to the gadget tab of the inventory.
18: [Parametric Transformer Cooldown] Make the parametric transformer's cooldown a little bit lower, from 6d22h to 6d20h, to make it less of a pain to use it every week at the same time for organization's sake. Or make it usable once per week without a cooldown like escoffier's cooking.
19: [Raiden and Beidou] Fix Raiden burst not working with beidou.
